Enhance your Gravity Forms to include anti-spam measures originally based on the work of David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

== Description ==

This Gravity Forms add-on blocks spam using a non-obtrusive anti-spam measure and can email a spam report summary.


## Spam blocking

To get started, all you need to do is activate the plugin!

### Is the Gravity Forms honeypot field not working for you? üçØ üêù

Zero Spam is better than the Gravity Forms anti-spam honeypot field. If you're getting spammed, try this plugin.

### Use instead of reCaptcha

**reCaptcha is user-hostile!** Use this instead! Users don't need to click stoplights, crosswalks, or bicycles when you use this plugin to stop spam.

### Enable or disable per-form

If you only want the plugin for specific forms, that's possible! The plugin adds a simple "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam" setting to each form (requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer).

## Spam report emails

Spam summary report emails are disabled by default. Once enabled, a spam summary that includes the number of entries per-form will be sent via email.

Choose whether you want to be notified after the number of entries reaches a threshold (e.g. 10 spam entries) or after a certain number of days (e.g. every week). If there are no spam entries, no report will be sent.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the Gravity Forms Zero Spam plugin stop email notifications from being emailed when a message is considered spam? =

Yes! When this plugin marks an entry as spam, it prevents processing of any configured notifications and add-on feeds.

Note: When an entry is marked as Spam, it also prevents use of the configured confirmation. Users submitted a entry marked as Spam will see the default Gravity Forms ‚ÄúThanks for contacting us! We will get in touch with you shortly.‚Äù confirmation text instead.

= I have Gravity Forms 2.7 installed. Do I need this plugin? =

Gravity Forms 2.7 added functionality that has similar features to this plugin, but we're adding additional features soon‚Äîkeep this plugin installed!

= Does this plugin work in combination with other CAPTCHAs, honeypot fields, or spam blocker plugins? =

Yep, you can use this plugin in combination with all other spam-blocking plugins:

- Gravity Forms' Google reCaptcha feature
- WPBruiser
- Akismet
- Gravity Forms' honeypot fields
- GravityCaptcha
- –°leanTalk
- WP Armor
- fail2ban

Zero Spam will not interfere with the operation of those plugins. It also doesn't interfere with Gravity Forms' built-in honeypot functionality.

= What version of Gravity Forms does this work with? =

This works with all Gravity Forms releases after v2.3 (released June 2017).

= Will this block spam comments or registrations on my site? =

No. For that, we recommend Ben Marshall‚Äòs [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/).

= How do I disable Zero Spam on specific forms? =

1. Go to the form
2. Click on Settings
3. Under Form Options, disable "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam". _Don't see the setting? This feature requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer._
4. Save the settings

New form submissions will not be checked using Zero Spam.

= I only want on specific forms. How do I disable Zero Spam by default? =

To disable by default, from your Dashboard, go to Forms, then Settings, then the Zero Spam tab. Under the "Enable Zero Spam by Default" setting, choose "Disabled", then save the form.

Once you have saved the setting, to enable for specific forms:

1. Go to the form
2. Click on Settings
3. Under Form Options, enable "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam". _Don't see the setting? This feature requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer._
4. Save the settings

Now that form will use Zero Spam.

= Is this plugin PHP 7 and PHP 8 compatible? =

Yes.

= All entries are going to spam. What can I do? =

First, **de-activate and re-activate the plugin**. Then let us know on the support tab!

= Spam summary report emails =

You can enable a spam summary report email. This email will be sent to the email address configured in the "Spam Summary Email" setting on the Gravity Forms "Forms" menu, click Settings, then click the Zero Spam tab.
