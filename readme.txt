Enhance your Gravity Forms to include anti-spam measures originally based on the work of David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

== Description ==

This Gravity Forms add-on blocks spam using a non-obtrusive anti-spam measure. There are no settings or configuration needed: all you need to do is activate the plugin!

### Is the Gravity Forms honeypot field not working for you? üçØ üêù

Zero Spam is better than the Gravity Forms anti-spam honeypot field. If you're getting spammed, try this plugin.

### Use instead of reCaptcha

**reCaptcha is user-hostile!** Use this instead! Users don't need to click stoplights, crosswalks, or bicycles when you use this plugin to stop spam.

### Enable or disable per-form

If you only want the plugin for specific forms, that's possible! The plugin adds a simple "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam" setting to each form (requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer).

Requires [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/?partner_id=1210629&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1210629&utm_source=Katz%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the Gravity Forms Zero Spam plugin stop email notifications from being emailed when a message is considered spam? =

Yes! When this plugin marks an entry as spam, it prevents processing of any configured notifications and add-on feeds.

Note: When an entry is marked as Spam, it also prevents use of the configured confirmation. Users submitted a entry marked as Spam will see the default Gravity Forms ‚ÄúThanks for contacting us! We will get in touch with you shortly.‚Äù confirmation text instead.

= Does this plugin work in combination with other CAPTCHAs, honeypot fields, or spam blocker plugins? =

Yep, you can use this plugin in combination with all other spam-blocking plugins:

- Gravity Forms' Google reCaptcha feature
- WPBruiser
- Akismet
- Gravity Forms' honeypot fields
- GravityCaptcha
- –°leanTalk
- WP Armor
- fail2ban

Zero Spam will not interfere with the operation of those plugins. It also doesn't interfere with Gravity Forms' built-in honeypot functionality.

= What version of Gravity Forms does this work with? =

This works with all Gravity Forms releases after v2.3 (released June 2017). The plugin also blocks bots in the latest Gravity Forms 2.5!

= Will this block spam comments or registrations on my site? =

No. For that, we recommend Ben Marshall‚Äòs [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/).

= How do I disable Zero Spam on specific forms? =

1. Go to the form
2. Click on Settings
3. Under Form Options, disable "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam". _Don't see the setting? This feature requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer._
4. Save the settings

New form submissions will not be checked using Zero Spam.

= I only want on sepecific forms. How do I disable Zero Spam by default? =

To disable by default, add this code to your site ([here's how](https://docs.gravityview.co/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)):

`add_filter( 'gf_zero_spam_check_key_field', '__return_false' );`

Once you have added that code to your site:

1. Go to the form
2. Click on Settings
3. Under Form Options, enable "Prevent spam using Gravity Forms Zero Spam". _Don't see the setting? This feature requires Gravity Forms 2.5 or newer._
4. Save the settings

Now that form will use Zero Spam.

= Is this plugin PHP 7 and PHP 8 compatible? =

Yes.

= All entries are going to spam. What can I do? =

First, **de-activate and re-activate the plugin**. Then let us know on the support tab!
