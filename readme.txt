Enhance your Gravity Forms to include anti-spam measures originally based on the work of David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

== Description ==

This Gravity Forms add-on blocks spam using a non-obtrusive anti-spam measure. There are no settings or configuration needed: all you need to do is activate the plugin!

**reCaptcha is user-hostile!** Use this instead! Users don't need to click stoplights, crosswalks, or bicycles when you use this plugin to stop spam.

Requires [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/?partner_id=1210629&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1210629&utm_source=Katz%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.).

_Brought to you by [GravityView](https://gravityview.co?utm_source=plugin&utm_campaign=zero-spam&utm_content=readme). We create essential Gravity Forms Add-Ons._

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin PHP 7 compatible? =

Yes.

= Does this plugin work in combination with other CAPTCHAs or spam blocker plugins? =

Yep, you can use this plugin in combination with all other spam-blocking plugins:

- Gravity Forms' Google reCaptcha feature
- WPBruiser
- Akismet
- Gravity Forms' honeypot fields
- GravityCaptcha
- СleanTalk
- WP Armor
- fail2ban

Zero Spam will not interfere with the operation of those plugins.

= What version of Gravity Forms does this work with? =

This works with all Gravity Forms releases after v2.3 (released June 2017). The plugin also blocks bots in the latest Gravity Forms 2.5!

= Will this block spam comments or registrations on my site? =

No. For that, we recommend Ben Marshall‘s [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/).
