Enhance your Gravity Forms to include anti-spam measures originally based on the work of David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique.

== Description ==

This Gravity Forms add-on blocks spam using a non-obtrusive anti-spam measure. There are no settings or configuration needed: all you need to do is activate the plugin!

Do you not want to use ReCAPTCHA because it's user-hostile? Use this instead! There are no stoplights or crosswalks here.

Originally based on David Walsh's "Zero Spam" technique. Requires [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/?partner_id=1210629&irgwc=1&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1210629&utm_source=Katz%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin PHP7 compatible? =

Yes.

= Will this block spam comments or registrations on my site? =

No. For that, we recommend Ben Marshallâ€˜s [WordPress Zero Spam plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zero-spam/).
